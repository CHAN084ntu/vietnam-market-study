## Inflation Dynamics

### Historical Inflation (CPI)

| Year | Inflation (YoY) | Food Inflation | Core Inflation | Notes |
|------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| 2024E | 3.5% | 4.2% | 2.8% | Stable, within target |
| 2023 | 3.2% | 3.8% | 2.5% | Well-controlled |
| 2022 | 3.2% | 4.5% | 2.1% | Global inflation spillover |
| 2021 | 1.8% | 2.1% | 1.5% | Low due to lockdowns |
| 2020 | 3.2% | 5.1% | 2.0% | Food price volatility |
| 2019 | 2.8% | 3.2% | 2.5% | Target range |
| 2018 | 3.5% | 3.8% | 3.2% | Higher food prices |

**State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) Target**: 3.5-4% annually

**Key Drivers**:
- **Food prices** (40% of CPI basket): Weather, pork prices, imports
- **Energy**: Oil prices, electricity tariffs
- **Housing**: Rent, construction costs rising
- **Policy**: SBV actively manages through interest rates, FX intervention

### Inflation Impact on Markets

**Positive Correlation** (0.3-0.4):
- Moderate inflation (3-4%) generally supportive
- Real estate stocks benefit from rising prices
- Banks benefit from higher lending rates

**Threshold Effects**:
- **<2%**: Concerns about growth slowdown
- **2-4%**: Sweet spot for equities
- **>5%**: Negative for stocks (tightening fears)

## Currency Dynamics (VND)

### Exchange Rate Trends

The Vietnamese Dong (VND) is managed by the State Bank of Vietnam within a trading band.

| Year | USD/VND | YoY Change | Stability |
|------|---------|------------|-----------|
| 2024 | 24,500 | -1.5% | Stable band |
| 2023 | 24,150 | +2.8% | Widened band |
| 2022 | 23,500 | +3.2% | Depreciation pressure |
| 2021 | 22,800 | +0.5% | Managed stability |
| 2020 | 22,700 | +1.1% | COVID volatility |
| 2019 | 22,500 | +0.9% | Gradual depreciation |

**Trading Band**: ±5% around reference rate (widened from ±3% in 2023)

### Currency Management

**SBV Policy**:
- Manages VND against USD basket (with some flexibility)
- Intervenes to smooth volatility
- Maintains FX reserves of $100B+ (>4 months of imports)
- Gradual depreciation to support exports

**Impact on Investors**:
- **Unhedged**: Gradual VND depreciation (1-2% annually) erodes returns
- **Hedged**: Forward costs ~2-3% annually
- **Net Effect**: Most investors accept FX risk (cost of doing business)

### Convertibility Constraints

**Current Status**: VND is not freely convertible
- **Restrictions**: Capital controls limit large FX conversions
- **Repatriation**: Foreign investors can repatriate profits/capital with documentation
- **Timeline**: No clear timeline for full convertibility (potential barrier to MSCI EM)

**Workarounds**:
- Offshore NDF (Non-Deliverable Forward) markets exist
- Some banks offer forward contracts (limited tenors)
- Accept FX risk as part of emerging market exposure

## Interest Rate Environment

### Policy Rates

| Year | Refinancing Rate | Rediscount Rate | Deposit Ceiling | Lending Rates |
|------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 2024 | 4.5% | 3.0% | N/A (removed) | 8-11% |
| 2023 | 4.5% | 3.0% | N/A | 8-10% |
| 2022 | 6.0% | 4.5% | N/A | 10-13% |
| 2021 | 4.0% | 2.5% | N/A | 7-9% |

**Key Changes**:
- Deposit ceiling removed (2015) - market-determined rates
- SBV uses refinancing rate as main policy tool
- Real rates currently ~1% (nominal 4.5% - inflation 3.5%)

**Impact on Equities**:
- **Low rates** (2021): Positive for growth stocks, real estate
- **Rising rates** (2022): Pressure on valuations, prefer banks
- **Stabilizing rates** (2023-24): Supportive for broad market

## Fiscal Policy & Government Debt

### Government Finances

| Metric | 2024E | 2023 | 2022 | Trend |
|--------|-------|------|------|-------|
| Fiscal Deficit (% GDP) | -3.8% | -4.2% | -4.0% | Widening |
| Government Debt (% GDP) | 42% | 39% | 37% | Rising |
| Debt Service Ratio | 12% | 11% | 10% | Manageable |

**Debt Composition**:
- **Domestic**: 65% (government bonds)
- **External**: 35% (multilateral, bilateral)
- **Maturity**: Average 7-8 years
- **Rating**: BB (S&P), Ba3 (Moody's) - stable outlook

**Fiscal Sustainability**:
- Debt levels moderate (vs 60% threshold)
- Improving tax collection (digitalization)
- Risk: Contingent liabilities from SOEs, banks

## Macroeconomic Indicators & Market Impact

### Leading Indicators for Equity Markets

**Positive Correlations** (use for tactical allocation):

| Indicator | Lead Time | Correlation | Trading Signal |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| PMI Manufacturing | 1-2 months | +0.65 | >50 = bullish |
| Export Growth (YoY) | 1 month | +0.55 | >10% = bullish |
| Credit Growth (YoY) | 2-3 months | +0.50 | >12% = bullish |
| FDI Commitments | 3-6 months | +0.45 | Rising = bullish |
| Real Estate Prices | 2-4 months | +0.40 | Rising = bullish |

**Negative Correlations**:

| Indicator | Lead Time | Correlation | Trading Signal |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| USD/VND Depreciation | 1 month | -0.35 | >3% = bearish |
| Oil Prices | 1 month | -0.30 | Sharp rise = bearish |

### Key Policy Reforms

**Recent Reforms (2020-2024)**:
1. **Securities Law** (2020): Improved disclosure, enforcement
2. **Corporate Bond Market**: Tighter regulations (2021-22) after defaults
3. **Real Estate Law** (2023): Streamlined approvals
4. **Land Law** (2024): Clarified ownership rights
5. **FDI Liberalization**: Opening more sectors to foreign investment

**Upcoming Reforms** (watch closely):
- **Public Investment Law**: Faster infrastructure approvals
- **Derivatives Market**: Expanding products (options, single-stock futures)
- **FX Liberalization**: Gradual relaxation of controls (MSCI requirement)
- **Electricity Market**: Deregulation, renewable energy support

## Macro Risk Factors

### Domestic Risks

**1. Political Uncertainty**
- **Impact**: Policy shifts, regulatory changes
- **Probability**: Medium (stable one-party system, but factionalism exists)
- **Mitigation**: Diversify holdings, avoid policy-sensitive sectors

**2. Credit Quality**
- **Issue**: Bank NPLs, corporate bond defaults
- **Current Status**: NPLs ~2% (official), potential hidden NPLs
- **Mitigation**: Stick to well-capitalized banks (VCB, BID), avoid weak credits

**3. Real Estate Bubble**
- **Concern**: Overheated property market, especially HCMC
- **Indicators**: Price-to-income ratios elevated, speculation
- **Risk**: Correction could impact banks, construction sector

### External Risks

**1. US-China Trade War**
- **Impact**: Vietnam benefits (trade diversion), but risk of tariffs
- **Current**: Some tariff threats on Vietnamese exports
- **Mitigation**: Monitor trade policy, diversify export sectors

**2. Global Recession**
- **Impact**: Export demand collapse (85% of GDP)
- **Scenario**: 2008-09 style shock = -20% to -30% market decline
- **Mitigation**: Hedge with USD assets, reduce exposure

**3. Commodity Prices**
- **Impact**: Oil imports (Vietnam is net importer), inflation
- **Scenario**: Oil >$100 = inflation >5%, negative for equities
- **Mitigation**: Monitor energy sector, consider commodity hedges

## Quantitative Models

### GDP-to-VN-Index Relationship

**Model**: VN-Index = α + β × GDP Growth + ε

**Results** (regression 2015-2024):
- **α** (intercept): 300
- **β** (coefficient): 60
- **R²**: 0.45
- **Interpretation**: 1% GDP growth → ~60 points on VN-Index

**Trading Strategy**:
- Use GDP forecasts to set index targets
- Overweight when GDP growth >6.5%
- Underweight when GDP growth <5%

### Inflation-Equity Return Relationship

**Model**: Real Return = Nominal Return - Inflation

**Historical Analysis** (2015-2024):

| Inflation Regime | Avg Nominal Return | Real Return | Best Sectors |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Low (<2%) | +8% | +6% | Growth stocks, tech |
| Moderate (2-4%) | +15% | +12% | Banks, diversified |
| High (>4%) | +5% | +1% | Commodities, real assets |

**Tactical Allocation**:
- **Low inflation**: Overweight growth, tech
- **Moderate inflation**: Balanced, favor quality
- **High inflation**: Defensive, real assets, banks
